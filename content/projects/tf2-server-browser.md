+++

This is an alternative server browser for TF2 (and potentially other Source games in the future)
that supports advanced filtering, including numerical ranges and filter negation. It is
written in Python 3, and uses the CherryPy web framework to expose a user interface.
It's currently under development and is coming <s>"soon" (read: whenever I
optimize it so it isn't dog slow)</s> almost certainly never.
