`alexa` is a Python library that interfaces with and automates various services related to
Amazon Alexa/Echo. The API isn't stable at the moment, but it has working code for
speech synthesis and use of the Alexa Voice Service v1.

<s>Check out [alexa on GitHub](https://github.com/schlarpc/alexa).</s>

Unfortunately, my employer requested that I get a formal review of this package before releasing it
to the public. I've pulled down the GitHub repo in the meantime, pending me caring enough to get the
project reviewed.
