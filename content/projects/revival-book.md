Revival Book is a small Forge mod for Minecraft 1.5.2
intended to create a better experience for cooperative or faction-based
(Ultra) Hardcore multiplayer servers. In particular, it was developed for
personal use with the Feed the Beast "Ultra Hard Survival" pack, which is a
modpack with difficult enemies and no natural health regeneration. The
problem with running a Hardcore multiplayer server is, of course, that the
number of living players will steadily decrease. This mod introduces a
method by which a dedicated player can resurrect a fallen comrade through a
significant investment of resources.

By crafting an Enchanted Golden Apple (the one made with Blocks of Gold -
72 ingots!) with a Book, you can create the Revival Book. Simply right-click
with the book in your hand to get a list of dead players on your Hardcore
server. Choose a player and click the "Revive" button to unban them from the
server. The revived player will also be teleported to the location where you
used the Revival Book, and will have 3 hearts when they log in.
