Chapter 5: CORS Blimey!
-----------------------

As of the end of chapter 3, we'd managed to set up a minimal frontend and backend for our serverless
application. What we haven't done, though, is show how the two can communicate. Right now, the two
pieces live on wildly different domains, with ugly autogenerated names given to us by their
respective services. In this chapter, we're going to use Route 53 to configure DNS for our service,
configure CORS to allow the frontend to talk to the backend, and prove that it works with a bit of
cross-domain scripting.
