# About

<s>`Chaz Schlarp`, or `schlarpc` is a library for Python 3.2 or later that</s>

Wait, no, that's not quite right. I'm `Chaz Schlarp`, or `schlarpc`, and I make things and break
other things using computers. I'm currently working at Amazon Web Services as an Application
Security Engineer developing some pretty cool automated security tools. (and if you're interested in
doing that, too, [email me](mailto:schlarpc@amazon.com)!)

Outside of that, I mostly do your standard computer geek stuff -
[PC gaming](https://steamcommunity.com/id/schlarpc),
some [Python programming and web shenanigans](https://github.com/schlarpc), that sort of thing.
This site is mainly to catalog those personal projects, so don't expect anything too exciting.

If you need to contact me directly for whatever reason, feel free to email me at
[schlarpc@gmail.com](mailto:schlarpc@gmail.com).
